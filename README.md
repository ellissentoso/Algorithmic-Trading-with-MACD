## About The Project

This uses program use MACD crossover to determine when to buy and sell a stock.
MACD, which stands for moving average convergence/divergence, is a trading indicator
used in stock price technical analysis. It is intended to reveal changes in the strength, 
direction, momentum, and duration of a stock's price trend. The MACD indicator is made up 
of three time series that are calculated from historical price data, most commonly the closing price.
